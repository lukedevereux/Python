Cats are super cool they are the best things in the world
Cats can't be trusted I don’t like them
Dogs are so loyal I love them
Cats are like fluffy diamonds
Cats can be very mean sometimes
Hmmmm I think dogs are okay
Snakes….now there is a pet. So cool!
Rabbits make my heart jump.
Rabbits eat broccoli and carrots…that's healthy.
Cats are evil. But I kinda like them.
A dogs hug is like a warm blanket at the end of a tough day.
